Markets API
API Overview

Bitcoincharts provides a simple API to most of its data. You can use this API to include markets data in your websites, mobile apps or desktop applets. Please remember to add a link to Bitcoincharts!

Bitcoincharts' API is accessable through HTTP
Parameters are passed using GET-requests
returned data is JSON encoded
Don't query more often than once every 15 minutes!
Weighted Prices

Bitcoincharts offers weighted prices for several currencies at http://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/weighted_prices.json. You can use this to price goods and services in Bitcoins. This will yield much lower fluctuations than using a single market's latest price.

Weighted prices are calculated for the last 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days. If there are no trades during an interval (like no trade within 24 hours) no value will be returned. Prepare your code to handle this cases!

The returned JSON is dictionary with elements for each currency. Each currency has up to three key-value pairs: 24h, 7d and 30d.
